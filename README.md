# FINVIEW - Personal Finances

## Project Description

FINVIEW is a web application that simulates a simple stock trading platform. Users can register, log in, and manage their virtual portfolios by buying and selling stocks. The application interacts with the Yahoo Finance API to retrieve real-time stock data, allowing users to see current stock prices and track their investments.

## Features

- **User Registration and Login:** Users can create an account, log in, and manage their portfolio.
- **Quote:** Users can search for real-time stock prices.
- **Buy Stocks:** Users can buy stocks in fractional amounts and add them to their portfolio.
- **Sell Stocks:** Users can sell the stocks in their portfolio. The interface automatically groups multiple purchases of the same stock.
- **Portfolio Overview:** Users can view their portfolio, including the number of shares they own, the current price, and the total value.
- **Transaction History:** Users can view their past transactions, including a button to clear the history if desired.
- **Add/Withdraw Cash:** Users can add or withdraw cash from their account. Withdrawals are limited to the available balance.
- **Stock Info:** Users can see detailed information about stocks, including the company name, current price, market capitalization, P/E ratio, 52-week high and low, and daily price change.

## Technologies Used

- **Flask:** A lightweight WSGI web application framework.
- **SQLite:** A lightweight database engine.
- **Yahoo Finance API:** Used to retrieve stock prices and related data.
- **Bootstrap:** Frontend framework for building responsive web interfaces.
- **Python:** Main programming language used for the backend logic.
- **Jinja2:** Templating engine used to dynamically generate HTML content.

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/finview.git
    cd finview
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** and activate it:

    ```bash

    ```plaintext
    FLASK_APP=app
    FLASK_ENV=development
    SECRET_KEY=<your-secret-key>
    ```

    Replace `<your-secret-key>` with a secure key for your Flask application.

6. **Run the application**:

    Start the Flask development server with the following command:

    ```bash
    flask run
    ```

7. **Access the application**:

    Open your web browser and navigate to:
